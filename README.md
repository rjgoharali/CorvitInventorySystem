# CorvitInventorySystem
The Inventory System is a lightweight front-end application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no frameworks or servers. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter products by category, with a clean responsive UI, modal forms, and dynamic tables. Data is stored in memory, making it perfect for demos, small shops.
